I wanted to learn and practice modeling spiking neurons with Brian 2 https://briansimulator.org/ and thought it would be fun to output the synthesized spike trains to sound instead of plots. This allows for both data sonification of simulated neurons and an interesting way to make music

To use a spiking neuron model to trigger 808 drum samples, run brianSequence.py. Change the parameters for different patterns, and point it at different wav files if you want to make tracks with different sounds.

Next steps will involve making small networks of spiking neurons that excite and inhibit each other to make more complex patterns with multiple instruments.
